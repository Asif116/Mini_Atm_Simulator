# Mini_Atm_Simulator
ATM Machine Simulator in Java This repository contains a Java-based ATM Machine Simulator that demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 

The simulator allows users to perform essential banking operations such as balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, viewing a mini statement, and creating new accounts.  

Features: Balance Inquiry: Quickly check your account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Securely withdraw funds with real-time balance updates.
Deposit Funds: Deposit money and see the updated balance immediately. 
Mini Statement: Access a summary of recent transactions.
Create New Account: Easily set up new accounts with user-specific details.

OOP Concepts Implemented: Encapsulation: Core classes like Account, ATM, and Transaction encapsulate data and functionality. Inheritance: Supports different account types (e.g., Savings, Checking) using inheritance. Polymorphism: The ATM interface handles various account types consistently, with specific behavior based on the account.
